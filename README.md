# SHL-Assessment-Recommendation-Engine
This project implements a semantic recommendation engine for SHL assessments using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline with Gemini embeddings. The system processes a catalog of assessments and enables users to retrieve the most relevant assessments based on a query or requirement.
